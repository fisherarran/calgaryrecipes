*__INGREDIENTS__*

1 lb flank steak or sirloin steak, sliced into narrow strips
3/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 cup water
2 eggs
1 large carrot, julienned
3 green onions, chopped
1/4 cup fresh ginger, minced
5 cloves garlic, minced
canola oil
3 tablespoons soy sauce
4 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1/2 cup sugar 

*__PREPARATION__*
Place cornstarch in a large bowl. Add water gradually while whisking. Beat eggs into cornstarch mixture. Toss in beef and stir to coat. Pour 1 inch of oil into pan (I used a pot, it helps cut down on splashes), heat until boiling hot, but not smoking. Add a quarter of the beef to the oil. Separate with a fork and cook, stirring frequently, until crispy, Remove, drain on paper towel and set aside. Repeat until all the beef is cooked. Drain off all oil except for about 1 tablespoons and add carrots, onion, ginger, and garlic in that order. Stir fry briefly over high heat. Combine last 5 ingredients and add to vegetable mixture. Bring to a boil and then add beef. Heat through and serve immediately. __CONSUME!__
